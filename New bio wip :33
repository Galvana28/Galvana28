Helo! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 My name is Galvana! I'm hyperfixated on Pokémon and Eurovision a lot right now :3 actually nothing else to put here lmao ASK ME ABOUT ANYTHING i love answering questions

I'm quite bad at talking to people 😔😨 I make a lot of typos mostly because I'm really happy I love y'all /p . Sometimes it's difficult to find the right words. I use emojis a lot instead.

I have autism (who here doesn't?) EXPAND
