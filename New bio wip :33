Hello! My name is Galvana! I LOVE My Singing Monsters and Pokémon!! If you have any cosplays PLEASE show me 🤯 I'm also super hypefixated on Eurovision.

I'm quite bad at talking to people 😔😨 I'm ASS at keeping conversations going. I make a lot of typos mostly because I'm really happy I love y'all /p . Sometimes it's difficult to find the right words, so I use emojis instead.

I have autism (who here doesn't? /j) expand

⚡ **Galvana**, Zeraora, and Collei fictionkin (and otherkin)!! See [pronouns.cc](https://pronouns.cc/@Galvana28) for kinlist :33 sorry I'm usually uncomfortable with doubles </3 cosplays are fine
It also has a lil bit more about me, like more interests, names, and a couple more links.

Sign my [Strawpage](https://electropuppet.straw.page/) and [Atabook](https://galvana28.atabook.org/)!! I'll try to sign yours back :33
