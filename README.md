Hello! My name is Galvana! I LOVE My Singing Monsters and Pokémon!! If you have any cosplays PLEASE show me 🤯 I'm also super hypefixated on Eurovision and Super Mario 3D World.

I'm quite bad at talking to people 😔😨 I'm ASS at keeping conversations going. I make a lot of typos mostly because I'm really happy I love y'all /p . Sometimes it's difficult to find the right words, so I use emojis instead.

I have autism (who here doesn't? /j) i need to put more here gelp
